The following constructor is not compliant with the dependency inversion principle.
High-level module (Research) is dependent on a low-level module (Relationships).
The problem with this approach is - any future changes to Relationships will
effect the Research module because of this tight coupling. 
So, we can instead make it dependent on the interface
which is implemented by the low level module as in the above constructor.
